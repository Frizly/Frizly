Let's start with my background. After I graduated from college three years ago, my brother and I started a digital marketing agency together. Since then it is developing quite nicely and it has come to a point where it can function without my attention full-time. 

Due to this, I am now able to pursue my other passion - blockchain technology. The combination of marketing, design and web3 is a constant flow state for me. 

As for my experience with crypto, I have been following as much news as I can since 2017 and have been building my portfolio since then. For the past two years, it has become crystal clear to me that blockchain technology will enhance our world in a way we've never experienced before.
